I build this example with a system design for better structure and maintainable code, I created a file called utils where are all the variants that we can have in the project. Also, I used styled-components to build reusable components and a better understanding, I created components that we can use in other parts of the app. The components are functional components with hooks to have a clean component instead of using classes. Use yarn to install all the dependencies and start the project using yarn.
